This is a long description. It is very long... and complicated. You may not understand.
In case you do not, we suggest asking your clergy. If you are not the religious type,
you may want to find god, or some gods. Any will do really. they are all pretty much the
same. "Do good and I'll do good upon you..." yada yada yada... Sounds like Santa Claus
to me. You can choose Santa as your god if you like. I personally think he is the best.
At least he brings you real toys you can tough and see... Huh, what? He isn't real. Crap.
We're all hosed.
